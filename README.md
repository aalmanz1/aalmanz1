# Hello! üëã
## üòé About Me
üéì Hi! My name is Alex Almanza, and I am an aspiring game designer, developer, and recent college graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of the Pacific, Stockton CA. 

üë®‚Äçüíª My primary skills include project development and optimization, game mechanics and level design, and algorithm implementation. I hope to direct these skills towards innovation in game development and to facilitate excellent storytelling. I am proficient in many programming languages, including Python, C++, C#, and Java, and have developed extensively using both Unreal Engine and Unity. I also pride myself in my communication skills utilizing my minor in English!  

üé≤ Tech aside, I still like to keep myself busy! Creativity is where I excel. I enjoy playing as Dungeon Master for several Dungeons and Dragons games, mapmaking, reading, and writing. I also game quite frequently, both single-player and online with friends. I enjoy talking with people and have a pretty extensive Lego collection!

## üéñ Achievements
- Completed DevOps independent study working with GitHub Actions and workflows in an ongoing educational research project (December 2021)
- BS in Computer Science, minor in English (May 2021)
- 1st place at UOP's School of Engineering and Computer Science Senior Project Day (May 2021)
